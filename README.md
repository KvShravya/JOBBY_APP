In this project, I built a **Jobby App** by applying the concepts of React.js

### Refer to videos below:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <video style="max-width:80%;box-shadow:0 2.8px 2.2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);outline:none;" loop="true" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" muted>
    <source src="https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/jobby-app-success-output-v0.mp4" type="video/mp4">
